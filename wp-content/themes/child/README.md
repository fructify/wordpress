# Example Fructify Child Theme
This is an example of what your theme might look like, feel free to run with it

Each major section of the theme contains it's own README file.
Here are some concepts that apply to the theme as a whole.

Most of fructify implements a Hierarchical File System.

This means files in the child theme with the same name as a file in the parent
fructify theme will override that file. This provides ultimate control to the
child theme.
